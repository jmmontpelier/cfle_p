constitution was unquestionably an example of what Hamilton had described as “good government” in the first Federalist. Its constitution had carefully balanced and separated powers, and it could rightly claim the honor of being the first to recognize a “bill of rights” that protected the people against arbitary power. Political philosophers throughout the 17th and 18th centuries generally celebrated the British constitution for protecting the individual rights of every class of citizen better than any other government in the world.  Nonetheless, to the outside observer, the accumulation of rights in the English system of government must have seemed like a process that was partly organic and partly a matter of happenstance—like the accretion of so many barnacles encrusting the ship of state over the years. The foundations and original reasons for many of England’s common law rights, such as Magna Carta, had literally been wrested from the King by force. The American development of the Bill of Rights, by contrast, was meant to be a process of “deliberation and choice.” During the Framing and Ratifying periods, Americans deliberately selected the most cherished rights from the British tradition, but they would often provide their own rationales for these rights, incorporate them into their own unique institutions, and adapt them to their own situations.

But few notice (or perhaps understand) its allegation that the King had assented to “abolishing the free System of English Laws” in Quebec, followed by a not-so-subtle hint that he intended to do the same thing in the American colonies. Nonetheless, the shift in focus that took place during this time—from those rights that were bequeathed to them from the motherland to rights that were theirs by nature—had the effect of altering their perceptions of even those traditional rights they brought with them from England.   The American fascination with natural rights at the time of its Revolution would inevitably give rise to some differences between the ways that the two countries interpreted individual rights. Exactly fifty years after he penned the Declaration of Independence and less than two weeks before his death, Thomas Jefferson would exult: “All eyes are opened, or opening to the rights of man.” The natural rights philosophers that the American colonists read and absorbed—Locke, Burlamaqui, Pufendorf—were all either English or European, but the Americans tended to give them an even better reception than their compatriots. They saw the British constitution as only a means of protecting rights; the rights themselves were often innate.

For instance, the British government, at its best, merely “tolerated” other religions. Its starting point was the established Church of England, and all other religions were merely allowed to exist by its good graces. The Americans, however, came to understand religious belief as entirely prior to and separate from any superintendence of the state; the individual’s freedom of conscience was therefore afforded more respect than most political goals.  And,  the English had granted the right to “keep arms” only to Protestants, and only insofar as the arms were “suitable to their conditions.” Americans, by contrast, believed that the right to bear arms was derived from every man’s natural right to defend himself; they were therefore less willing to accept any restrictions on gun ownership. By changing the rationale for these rights, the Americans often ended in expanding their scope. And the years that have passed since the Founding have at times only widened the gulf separating how these two countries understand those rights today.

In many ways, Virginia’s grand achievement was like the Declaration of Independence, the United States Constitution, and the Bill of Rights all rolled together.

For instance, the accused had the right “to be confronted with the accusers and witnesses,” and to have “a speedy trial by an impartial jury,” and to be protected against “cruel and unusual punishments.” But its Declaration of Rights also began with an assertion of abstract natural rights principles, similar to the opening paragraphs of the Declaration of Independence:  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_150","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_150","title":"After combining what we think of as a bill of rights and many of the ideas in the Declaration of Independence in its Declaration of Rights, Virginia’s constitution begins by launching into an indictment of King George III, again reminiscent of the Declaration of Independence.

Two states elected to retain their old colonial charters. Of the eleven states that heeded Congress’ directive by adopting a new constitution, a total of seven attached a separate Declaration of Rights to it. The states that chose not to adopt a separate bill of rights, such as New York, generally incorporated some of the more essential rights, such as the right of habeas corpus, into the body of their constitutions.  Later, during the debates over the Bill of Rights, Americans would continue to disagree over the best way to protect their most cherished rights, and even where to place them in their political documents.

From the beginning he was, at best, ambivalent about the suggestion that a bill of rights would improve the Constitution as it was originally framed. The Constitutional Convention had decided against a bill of rights without much debate. During the Ratification debates, the Federalists were probably surprised to learn how zealously some Antifederalists would seize upon this issue as an argument against the Constitution as a whole. Madison ultimately conceded the necessity of a bill of rights, probably more because of the vigor of the popluar demand than because of the merits of their arguments. Still, Madison had his reasons for championing the cause of a bill of rights, some of which are worth revisiting today.  The subject of a bill of rights did not even come up in the Constitutional Convention until September 12, less than a week before the summer-long Convention adjourned. George Mason, who had been the primary author of Virginia’s Declaration of Rights, admitted that he “wished the plan had been prefaced with a bill of rights.” If he had succeeded in persuading the majority of the Convention, George Mason’s suggestion that a bill of rights should precede the Constitution would have made the United States Constitution look very much like many of the existing state constitutions.

The Constitution’s Framers had probably assumed that the process in Congress should be only a pro forma vote, and the real decision-making would take place in the state ratifying conventions. Instead, a heated debate ensued among the congressmen. Some of them insisted that the proposed Constitution should be amended by Congress before submitting it to the states.  James Madison described the ominous proceedings taking place in New York in a letter to George Washington: “An attempt was made, in the next place, by [Richard Henry Lee], to amend the act of the Convention before it should go forth from Congress. He proposed a bill of rights, provision for juries in civil cases, and several other things corresponding with the ideas of Col. Mason.” Many in Congress evidently thought that the omission of a bill of rights was a serious defect in the proposed Constitution, and it was Congress’ job to supply the defect before the states took up the question.  In the end, it was resolved “unanimously” to submit the unamended Constitution to the states.

Wilson urged his opponents to consider how much the American Constitution differed from the British constitution.  In the first place, Wilson argued, the proposed Constitution was to be established by “the people of the United States.” In Magna Carta, it is the King who grants liberties to his subjects, but his powers are otherwise presumed to be without limit.

Nonetheless, the Antifederalists were clearly outgunned by Pennsylvania’s Federalists—certainly in terms of numbers and possibly in terms of oratorical prowess. In the Virginia Convention, on the other hand, the two sides were more evenly matched. There, eloquent defenders of the Constitution, such as James Madison and John Marshall, went head-to-head against equally formidable detractors, such as George Mason and Patrick Henry. The ultimate outcome of this contest was by no means certain for either side. And once again the issue turned on whether the Constitution should be amended before it was adopted, and particularly whether it required a bill of rights.

Patrick Henry countered that, in fact, “there is a bill of rights in” the Constitution already. What he had in mind was Article I, Section 9, of the Constitution, which listed several limitations on the powers of Congress. Some of these limitations—such as restricting congressional powers to suspend the writ of habeas corpus or to pass ex post facto laws—were instituted for the same reason bills of rights were adopted: to protect the individual rights of citizens.  Then Henry turned the tables on those who argued that a bill of rights would be dangerous because it would imply that Congress possessed all powers that were not expressly denied. Section 9 of the first article, he said, already did that: “The fair implication is, that they can do  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_168","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_168","title":"every thing they are not forbidden to do.” Henry’s main quarrel was not with the specific limitations that Section 9 included, however. The problem was that it didn’t go far enough: “The restraints in this congressional bill of rights are so feeble and few, that it would have been infinitely better to have said nothing about it.” In order to safeguard the most important liberties of the people, this Constitution required a real bill of rights.  Edmund Randolph countered that the limitations on congressional powers named in Article I, Section 9, were not general limitations on powers, and therefore were not subject to the misconstructions that Patrick Henry had feared. Every express restriction on Congress in that section was aimed at curbing some power that was already granted elsewhere in the Constitution. For instance, “by virtue of the power given to Congress to regulate courts, they could suspend the writ of habeas corpus.” The clause that only allows the suspension of habeas corpus in certain restricted cases “is therefore an exception to that power.” It was wrong, therefore, to claim that the Constitution already had a bill of rights or that adding one would not subject the Constitution to all the dangers that were feared.

But would the Antifederalists agree?   Before the Convention could vote on the question of suggested amendments, the opposition moved that “previous to the ratification of the new Constitution,” a declaration of rights and other amendments “ought to be referred by this Convention to the other states in the American confederacy for their consideration.” That motion lost by a slim margin, 80 to 88.

Jefferson wrote that he was thoroughly unconvinced by the arguments from James Wilson, that a bill of rights was unnecessary in a government whose powers were already limited through enumeration. The doctrine of limited powers, he said, was “opposed by strong inferences from the body of the instrument.” He probably meant that he believed, along with Patrick Henry and “Centinel,” that certain clauses in the Constitution seemed to imply that Congress had broader powers than those specifically named in the Constitution.

The enumerated powers, when combined with “the jealousy of the [state] Governments, afford a security which has not existed in the case of the State Governments, and exists in no other.” The jealous state governments would operate as a check on the abuses of federal power; they would be a better check than any bill of rights ever could. Jefferson admitted that the jealousy of the state governments was “a precious reliance,” but he insisted that “they must have principles furnished them whereon to found their opposition. The declaration of rights will be the text whereby they will try all the acts of the federal government.” A bill of rights might even provide securities for the federal government as well as the states; it could protect the former whenever the states might lodge opposition against the legitimate use of federal powers.

He claimed that “experience proves the inefficacy of a bill of rights on those occasions when its controul is most needed.” State governments had been guilty of “repeated violations of these parchment barriers.” Bills of rights were ineffectual in American states for a reason, Madison thought: democratic majorities always ignored them at their convenience.  Madison had given a lot of thought to the problem of majority tyranny. The “danger of oppression” in government, he said, always arose from the quarter that held the power. A bill of rights in a monarchy can serve as a standard of legitimate power that the King must be held accountable to, and a call-to-arms in the people if it is ever transgressed. By contrast, “in a popular Government, the political and physical power may be considered as vested in the same hands, that is, in a majority of the people.” As a consequence, in democratic governments, there is no latent and opposing force strong enough to champion the cause of rights whenever they were abused by the visible power. If the majority acts like a tyrant, they cannot be checked “by the dread of an appeal to any other force within the community.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_163","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_163","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_164","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_164","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_199","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_199","title":"James Madison.

If the country were without a bill of rights when one were needed, they would face evils that are “permanent, afflicting and irreparable: they are in constant progression from bad to worse.”  Jefferson concluded his rebuttal on an optimistic note: “I am much pleased with the prospect that a declaration of rights will be added: and hope it will be done in that way which will not endanger the whole frame of the government, or any essential part of it.” Jefferson knew he could enjoy this verbal parry and thrust with Madison free from worry, because his friend had already decided in favor of a bill of rights.  Jefferson’s letter rebutting Madison’s arguments against a bill of rights arrived only a few weeks before Madison’s proposal in the First Congress would introduce the topic, and many of Jefferson’s arguments made it into Madison’s speech before the House.

It was not intended as a protection against state governments.

It was the only time in which we resolved a constitutional issue (slavery) not by force of argument but by force of arms. Immediately after the defeat of the slaveholding Confederacy, three new amendments were ratified which fundamentally changed the Constitution: the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments, commonly called the Reconstruction Amendments.    The 13th Amendment (1865) prohibited slavery throughout the United States; the 14th Amendment (1868) mandated certain standards of fairness and equality in how those former slaves could be treated; and the 15th Amendment (1870) sought to guarantee the voting rights of former slaves—at least former male slaves. These changes were so fundamental that some scholars consider the Reconstruction Amendments to have created a second American constitution.  The Constitution of 1787 contained very few limitations on the powers of state governments, and the Bill of Rights had not added any more to that list. The 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments, however, were intended to place some serious restrictions on what the states could do.

One such interpretation occurred in 1925, in Gitlow v. New York, a case in which the U.S. Supreme Court considered whether the 1st Amendment’s protection of freedom of expression applied to the states.   This was not the first time that “incorporation” had been urged upon the Court. Scholars and litigants had been making such arguments for years, many of them arguing for “total incorporation”—that is, a blanket interpretation applying all of the Bill of Rights to the states. The Court had always rejected such arguments.  But in Gitlow, the Court began a careful process that has come to be called “selective incorporation.” Still refusing to incorporate the entirety of the Bill of Rights, the Court adopted the more limited proposition that “[f]or present purposes we may and do assume that freedom of speech and of the press—which are protected by the First Amendment from abridgment by Congress—are among the fundamental personal rights and ‘liberties’ protected by the due process clause of the 14th Amendment from impairment by the States.” Thus, the Court focused upon the word “liberty” in the 14th Amendment and decided that if a right mentioned in the Bill of Rights is important enough, if it is “fundamental” enough, then it should be incorporated against the state governments.

Connecticut, 1937). After Gitlow, it would be up to the Court to decide which other rights named in the Bill of Rights should, or should not, be deemed “fundamental” enough to be incorporated.   Identifying the particular rights that should be incorporated has been a matter of contention ever since. Some Justices, such as Hugo Black, believed that all of the rights guaranteed by the Bill of Rights should be incorporated, but that position has never commanded a majority of the Supreme Court. Instead, over the several decades following Gitlow, the Court selectively incorporated most of the Bill of Rights on a case-by-case basis.  This selective approach has meant that some rights would almost inevitably be left out, and, indeed, several provisions in the Bill of Rights—such as the grand jury requirement in the 5th Amendment and the right to a civil jury trial in the 7th Amendment—have never been recognized as applying to the states. The selective approach has also meant that the process of incorporation has been lengthy: the 2nd Amendment right to keep and bear arms was not incorporated until 2010.  쐀둪뒴뒴뒴뒴뒴￿￿￿￿￿￿￿￿￿￿￿￿￿￿￿￿￿￿￿￿￿￿￿￿￿櫿橪橪橪橪橪橪￾￿￿￿￿￿￿￿￿￿￿￿￿￿￿￿￿￿￿￿￿￿￿￿￿þ ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_241","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_241","title":"Justice Cardoza ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_207","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_207","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_242","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_242","title":"Palko v.

State laws, on the other hand, frequently present questions of constitutionality. Are the local police following the proper warrant procedures before searching a building? Does a city ordinance against strip clubs violate a stripper’s freedom of expression? Is the death penalty cruel and unusual punishment when it is applied to a juvenile offender?

That means that people have a legal right to certain kinds of government assistance when they are in need, but the kinds or amount of government assistance can and does change from one administration to the next. Many other countries have opted to incorporate these kinds of economic rights into their constitutions, which (theoretically, at least) make them more static and uniform.

The rights he was describing as economic were not merely an expansion of the existing kinds of rights that we have always enjoyed under the Constitution and the Bill of Rights; rather, he was introducing an entirely different kind of right. The American Founders were familiar with three important kinds of rights: one was natural and the other two—civil and political—followed from the natural kind. Natural rights are the ones that were given to us from the start and by nature: life, liberty, and property. Every person has the right to his own life; every person has the right to his own liberty; and every person has the right to whatever property he creates from the labor of his own hands. Those gifts of nature cannot be taken from people by anyone, even by the government, except under very particular circumstances.

Instead, you begin with the goods that people require in order to live a decent life—education, food, shelter, medical care—and then seek political means to provide them. Since nature doesn’t provide these goods automatically, an economic bill of rights would make the following guarantee to its citizens: whenever people are unable to provide themselves with those things necessary for living a good life, then government must provide those things for them.

However, the problem was that it did not go far enough: “The restraints in this congressional bill of rights are so feeble and few, that it would have been infinitely better to have said nothing about it.” In order to safeguard the most important liberties of the people, the Constitution required a real bill of rights.
