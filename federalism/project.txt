When the delegates to the Constitutional Convention met in Philadelphia in 1787, they perceived the words “federal” and “national” as having starkly different meanings, and they convened with very definite opinions about whether they wanted one or the other term applied to their Constitution. Some delegates arrived with a firm determination to shift sovereignty, or supreme power, to the central government, and create a national government. Other delegates arrived equally determined to retain sovereignty in the states, and protect their federal arrangement, as in the Articles of Confederation. Over the course of the summer, their opinions evolved toward a compromise position that would make this Constitution “partly federal and partly national” (a formula that Madison later defended in Federalist No. 39). But this debate was not merely a war over the abstract meanings of words. Specific provisions that were adopted or rejected as parts of this Constitution contributed to the complex structure of federalism that the Framers ultimately adopted. In particular, the rejected federal veto over state laws, the explicit prohibitions on state powers, the enumerated powers of Congress, and the “Supremacy Clause” were all ways to divide sovereignty between the state and federal governments. Indeed, their choices would forever change how we understand the meaning of the word “federal.”  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_165","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_165","title":"Federalist No. 39 ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_165","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_165","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_189","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_189","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_84","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_84","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17747","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17773","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_previous_125","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_125","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si21747","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si21772","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_next_126","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_next_126","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si21826","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si21851","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide14895","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Dual Sovereignty","thumbnail":"dr/Slide14895_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si14929","si14931","Text_Caption_117","Text_Caption_118","Text_Caption_165","Image_165","Image_189","Button_84","si17747","si17773","btn_previous_125","si21747","si21772","btn_next_126","si21826","si21851"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide14895"}}},{"id":"si15009","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si15011","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_38","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_38","title":"Federalism ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_24","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_24","title":"The 10th Amendment ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_119","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_119","title":"A “Rule of Construction” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_120","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_120","title":"During the ratification debates, the Antifederalists had demanded that something like the 10th Amendment be added to the Constitution in order to prevent possible misinterpretations of the relationship between federal and state powers. Simply stated, the 10th Amendment was meant to affirm that the federal government could exercise no powers except those which were enumerated in the Constitution. All remaining powers were reserved to the state governments and the people. It is therefore what lawyers commonly call “a rule of construction,”—a guide to interpreting a law—in this case, a guide to interpreting the Constitution itself.  Despite the 10th Amendment’s history and (relatively) plain language, the Supreme Court has, at various times in our nation’s history, found that the amendment is more than “a truism”—that it does more than simply describe the difference between state and national power. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Court often interpreted the 10th Amendment as limiting the powers given to the national government. The Court reversed course at the end of the Great Depression, and rarely cited the 10th Amendment for the following 50 years. But then, in the 1990s, the Court twice cited the 10th Amendment as at least part of its rationale for striking down intrusive federal statutes.

Federalism presents significant problems which include the shifting boundaries defining the areas in which Congress can or cannot act, as well as the potential for overlap in the separate areas of authority for the states and federal government.

The principle that runs through subsequent interpretations of the 14th Amendment is that the federal government can directly regulate states in areas that had been traditionally left to states. The 14th Amendment places limits on how states can structure their laws and treat their citizens. States cannot abridge the privileges and immunities of U.S. citizens; they must provide due process; and they must provide for the equal protection of the laws. These are structural limitations on state governments.  Though the limitations are consistent with liberty, they are a significant restructuring of the relationship between the federal government and the states. Since this amendment has been interpreted to mean that Congress can monitor the limitations placed on the states, and Congress is given the power to enforce the 14th Amendment’s limitations through Section 5, the result has been a dramatic shift of power to the federal government.

A federal government, on the other hand, would be a collection of sovereign and independent states which delegated limited powers to a central body through a treaty or alliance.

That question cannot be answered without first addressing whether or not there can be such a thing as “divided sovereignty.” Many people think not.

James Wilson had made that point in the PA Ratifying Convention on December 1, 1787. (Click on the image, left, to see James Wilson’s comment on sovereignty.)  Madison had even wanted to establish that principle in the Preamble of the Constitution by adding through amendment “that all power is originally vested in, and consequently derived from, the people” (JM’s proposed Bill of Rights, delivered to the House on June 8, 1789). It is the people, then, who decide what authority or authorities will wield sovereign power on their behalf. And under the Constitution of the United States, “the delegated sovereignty is divided between the General and the State Governments” (JM to Thomas Ritchie, Dec. 18, 1825). But not everyone was destined to agree with that formulation. And even among the proponents of divided sovereignty, locating precisely where that demarcation lay, and how it would be enforced, was in some respects left vague. The issues of sovereignty would revolve around how broadly the “enumerated powers” were interpreted, and who would determine the boundary line when there was a dispute between state and federal authority.

Later, Southern states would carry this doctrine to its extremes, claiming that as sovereign states they had the right to secede from the federal compact.

These cases were a slight reversal of the prevailing trend in the 20th century that had given very expansive interpretations to the Commerce Clause. In New York v. United States (1992) a federal statute attempted to force states to adopt federal regulations for the disposal of low-level nuclear waste within their states by mandating that they accept ownership of such waste if they failed to implement the regulations. The Court struck down the relevant part of the federal statute, saying:   The take title provision appears to be unique. No other federal statute has been cited which offers a state government no option other than that of implementing legislation enacted by Congress. Whether one views the take title provision as lying outside Congress’ enumerated powers, or as infringing upon the core of state sovereignty reserved by the 10th Amendment, the provision is inconsistent with the federal structure of our Government and established by the Constitution.

State governments are niether regional offices nor administrative agencies of the Federal Government.
