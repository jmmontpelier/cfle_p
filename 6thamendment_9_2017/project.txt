Indeed, it was such an obvious principle to the American Founders that they rarely had anything to say about it. Several state constitutions had included guarantees that were similar to the one found in Virginia’s Declaration of Rights: “That in all capital or criminal prosecutions a man hath a right to demand the cause and nature of his accusation.” The wording may have changed slightly between states, but its meaning was always clear: the state could not lock up a person without explaining why—abusing this principle has been the privilege of tyrants throughout history.  There are other reasons why it is necessary to inform a suspect of the nature of the accusation against him. Perhaps the most compelling is that a suspect could not ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_117","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_117","title":"prepare an effective defense unless he knew the particulars of the charge. Finally, if the state could arrest an individual, keep him incarcerated, and question him, all without informing him of its reasons for doing so, then it would nullify many of our other rights.  The 6th Amendment right of a suspect “to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation” is closely tied to at least three of the protections found in the 5th Amendment. It is the job of the Grand Jury, after all, to specify (or “inform”) in an indictment what are the particular charges against the accused. And this indictment is also necessary for ensuring that the accused shall not “be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.” Unless the prosecutor is compelled to be specific about the charges against a suspect before he is brought to trial, there would be no way to test whether a suspect was being subjected to “double jeopardy” for the same offense. Finally, this provision enables the prisoner to guard against self-incrimination. If a defendant knows the nature and cause of the accusation, then he will be a better judge of the purpose of any questions that the police or the prosecutor might ask. He will be more likely to know which answers will have the tendency to make him “a witness against himself.”  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"btn_previous_93","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_previous_93","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17870","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17895","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"btn_next_94","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"btn_next_94","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17949","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17974","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide14856","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Nature and Cause of Accusation","thumbnail":"","children":["si6543","si14890","Text_Caption_116","Text_Caption_117","btn_previous_93","si17870","si17895","btn_next_94","si17949","si17974"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide14856"}}},{"id":"si14977","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si14979","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_38","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_38","title":"Accusation and the Right to Counsel ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_24","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_24","title":"The Right to Counsel ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_118","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_118","title":"The Right to Counsel in England ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_119","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_119","title":"The right of the accused to have the benefit of counsel for his defense was not always recognized in the common law; indeed, at one time it was denied in all but the most trivial cases. According to Blackstone’s 1769 Commentaries, in all capital crimes “it is a settled rule at common law, that no counsel shall be allowed a prisoner upon his trial.” An exception was only granted when “some point of law shall arise proper to be debated,” but that exception could be interpreted with great latitude by the judge.  This was one “settled rule” in English common law that Blackstone vehemently criticized. He claimed that the rule effectively required the judge to act as “counsel for the prisoner,” and he opined that such a law “seems to be not at all of a piece with the rest of the humane treatment of prisoners by the English law.” It seemed nonsensical to Blackstone that a prisoner could procure legal counsel for petty crimes and civil trials, yet it was “denied to save the life of a man” in capital crimes.   Joseph Story condemned the slowness of England in abandoning this rule: “The defect has indeed been cured in England in cases of treason; but it still remains unprovided for in all other cases.” Story praised Blackstone’s forthright condemnation of this “anomaly in the common law,” and he added that denying the accused the benefit of counsel in most cases was to “the discredit of the free genius of the English constitution.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_129","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_129","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_130","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_130","title":"Sir William Blackstone.

But Delaware’s Charter of 1701 went further, declaring: “That all Criminals shall have the same Privileges of Witnesses and Council as their Prosecutors.”  By the time America had declared independence, other states had likewise abandoned England’s “odious” precedent.

Throughout the 19th century, however, defense attorneys became increasingly the norm for all but the poorest defendants. And in many cases, lawyers would volunteer their services even for indigent clients, either through benevolence, or because novice attorneys wished to gain experience, or, in certain high-profile cases, because they sought the publicity.

But this case applied only to federal courts. Indeed, a 1942 case, Betts v. Brady, explicitly denied this constitutional guarantee to state courts.  In 1963, the Court, in Gideon v. Wainwright, incorporated this newer understanding of the 6th Amendment’s right to “have the assistance of counsel” into the 14th Amendment, so that it henceforth applied to the states. Gideon essentially adopted the standard of Zerbst, that courts may not “deprive an accused of his life or liberty unless he has or waives the assistance of counsel.” Gideon applied only to felonies; however; a 1973 decision, Argersinger v. Hamlin, recognized the right to counsel even in misdemeanor trials. And in a pair of cases decided in 2012 (Missouri v. Frye and Lafler v. Cooper), the Court upheld the 6th Amendment right to counsel during plea bargaining. Justice Kennedy, noting “the reality that criminal justice today is for the most part a system of pleas, not a system of trials,” determined that the 6th Amendment must adapt to that new reality.

The earliest English practice was to deny counsel in all but misdemeanor trials. Now, defendants in all criminal trials have a right to counsel except for the most petty offenses. This right is in force unless and until the defendant explicitly waives it. In fact, the Court has even held that the 6th Amendment protects its opposite: it guarantees to a defendant the right to represent himself [Faretta v. California (1975)]. And even this right to defend oneself may be denied if the court determines that the defendant is not competent to make that choice.

Even in the bad old days when these rights were being denied in practice, however, the best legal minds have always maintained that they are obvious preconditions for ensuring a fair and impartial trial. These rights give to a suspect the same opportunities to mount his defense that the prosecution is given to construct his accusation. These rights ensure that the state does not have its thumb on one side of the scales held by Lady Justice.
